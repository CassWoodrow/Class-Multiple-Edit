# Class-Attempts-Multiple-Edit

### Attempt 1
Ended in failure. Both version #037 and #038 failed to identify #009 in time. #009 still wins regardless of of if teamwork is in play. New testing is required, perhaps even stimulants will be allowed.

### Attempt 2
Ended in failure. Version #049 was the closest we have gotten and managed to succesfully identify #009. I personally believe if positive stimulants are given to #049 and negative stimulants given to #009 we may be able to see even better results.

 ### Attempt 3
 Ended in failure. Version #049 was given positive stimulants and #009 was given negative stimulants. It seems that the negative stimulants give to #009 managed to improve it somehow. Further testing of this is required. #049 however was lost.
 
 ### Attempt 4
 Ended in failure. Version #052 origanally saw even worse result than #023 however we did manage to recover #052 and with more attempts and training we have begun to see results simmilar to that of #049. Further training is required. We should attempt again after more training.
 
 ### Attempt 5
 Ended in Failure. Even with training given to version #052, #009 still managed to evade enough before the removal proccess could begin. Dr Leonard Hafner has requested that we move our focus back to team attempts. I am forced to agree with him as single version attempts have yet to bear fruit while Team Î´ has succesfully managed to identfy and start the remove of #007. Dr Morozov is not happy about this but with both of us against him he has no choice.
